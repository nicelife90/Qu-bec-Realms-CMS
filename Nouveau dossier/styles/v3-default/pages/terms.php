            <li>Donations<br/><br/>
                Please take a moment to review these rules detailed below. If you agree with them, then you may proceed
                with entering the website. No one from Blizzard, associated with Blizzard or any such affiliated company
                or anyone directed by Blizzard or its Related companies is permitted to enter these web sites or view
                any content contained within these sites at any time what so ever due to controversial reasons. You
                agree to give up all legal rights towards {copyright} when donating.
                Definitions and Interpretations<br/><br/>
                "Donation" or "Donate" is a legacy term whose current use means generically any purchase or exchange of
                money facilitated by {copyright}, regardless of intent to receive a product or service in return.
                <br/>"Purchase" means any exchange of funds for which entry into the {copyright} VIP Club is given. This
                term is used interchangeably with the term "donation".
                <br/>"User" or "Users" means any third party that accesses the web site and is not employed by
                {copyright} and acting in the course of their employment.
                <br/>"Certificate" means printed and mailed proof of membership in {copyright} VIP Club.
                <br/>"{copyright} VIP Club" or "VIP Club" means an exclusive group of users of the web site who have
                obtained exclusive and special status through their support or help. Members of this club may obtain
                special priviledges, status, and/or access to web site store products or services. Any special treatment
                or access to web site store access is not meant to be inferred as a direct purchase of these items, but
                instead as an indirect expression of gratitude from the web site for entry into the club. The direct
                reward is recognition of membership on the web site's forum, and a certificate of membership which is
                mailed upon purchase and choosing to receive the certificate from within the store.
                <br/>"Web Site" means the website that you are currently using www.{copyright}.com any sub-domains and
                subdomains of this site unless expressly excluded by their own terms and conditions.
                Refunds<br/><br/>
                {copyright} will not provide refunds under any circumstances. Membership in the {copyright} VIP Club is
                voluntary, and if a user does not wish to be a member, should not seek entry. If you are banned due to
                violation of our player rules, you will not get a refund. If you do not favor the service, you will not
                get a refund. If you unexpectedly did not receive your certificate, and don't have any proof of your
                purchase, you will not get a refund. You may appeal your case regarding your purchase on the forums by
                PM to a member of Management, and we will review your case, but we do not guarantee that you will
                receive any additional {copyright} VIP Club awards other than a certificate of membership and
                recognition on the web site's forum, as defined above. It's not required for you to make a purchase or
                join the club to enjoy the full experience of {copyright}; it's completely optional and is done at your
                own risk.
                <br/><br/>
                <br/><br/>Exchange<br/><br/>
                If you for any reason have store item(s) damaged, broken, lost, etc... you will not receive an exchange
                if you have opaque proof of your purchase into the VIP Club or not. Only a member of Management has the
                authority to replace your reward item if they feel the receipt you've presented is authentic.
                <br/><br/>
                Rewards<br/><br/>
                When you join the {copyright} VIP Club, it is understood that you're purchasing at your own risk. You
                are actually paying for a certificate of membership into the {copyright} VIP Club, which will be mailed
                to you with a tracking number and usually signature confirmation to verify it was received. If you do
                not receive the certificate, you may request it via an in-game support ticket or in the web site's
                store. Web site store items are exclusively indirect expressions of gratitude for your consideration in
                joining the {copyright} VIP Club and the perks that come with it. You're not purchasing any service,
                you're helping to keep our servers up. We're not selling virtual items; when you purchase, you take the
                risk(s) involved in purchasing as listed in the "Refund Policy".
                <br/><br/>
                Charge Backs
                Any attempts to reverse payment on a purchase will be met with an automatic and immediate IP address
                ban. All accounts tied to this IP address will be permanently banned. Our accounting team always
                contests each and every charge back and has a high success rate. If this fails, charge backs are
                routinely sent to a third-party collections agency, and the buyer's credit history will be affected if
                the charge is not paid for.
            </li>
            <br/><br/>
            <li>Indemnification<br/><br/>
                You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless, our subsidiaries, affiliates, related parties, officers,
                directors, employees, agents, independent contractors, advertisers, partners, and co-branders from any
                claim or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, that may be made by any third party, that is due
                to or arising out of your conduct or connection with this web site or service, your provision of
                Content, your violation of this Terms of Use or any other violation of the rights of another person or
                party.
